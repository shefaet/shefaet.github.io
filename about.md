I am a machine learning and natural language processing researcher currently
living and working in New York City.

These pages are introductory notes for novices in data science and machine
learning. They are not a complete review of the state-of-the-art, but I have
tried to write down what I wished had been available to me when I began studying
these subjects. I hope they prove useful.
